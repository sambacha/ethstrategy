#### **What is it?**

EtherStrategy (\$ETHXR) is a tokenized vehicle for ETH accumulation, giving \$ETHXR holders a claim on a growing pool of ETH managed through fully transparent, onchain strategies.

Think of EtherStrategy as **MicroStrategy, but entirely onchain and transparent**. If you’re familiar with how MicroStrategy operates, you already get the gist.

### **TL;DR**

1. **Deposit Pool:**  
   * The protocol starts with an initial ETH pool funded by early depositors.  
   * Early backers receive $ETHXR tokens, aligning their incentives with the protocol’s growth.
   * Global deposit cap at 10,000 $ETH
   * Individual addresses capped at 100 $ETH
2. **Growth Mechanisms:**  
   * **Convertible Bonds:** Users buy bonds with USDC. Proceeds are used to buy ETH, growing the pool and increasing $ETHXR’s value.  
   * **ATM Offerings:** If $ETHXR trades at a premium to NAV, new tokens are sold at the market price. Proceeds are used to acquire more ETH.  
   * **Net Asset Value (NAV) Options** \$oETHxr is an options contract that can be minted by governance that allows a holder to mint \$ETHXR by exchanging a proportional amount of NAV tokens relative to the total supply of $ETHXR
   * **Redemptions:** If $ETHXR trades at a discount to NAV, holders can vote to redeem ETH.

### **How It Works**

#### **1\. Convertible Bonds (USDC for ETH Acquisition):**

EtherStrategy raises funds by issuing **onchain convertible bonds**, which are structured as follows:

* **Initial Offering:**  
  * Bonds are sold at a fixed price in USDC with a maturity date and a strike price in $ETHXR.  
* **Conversion Option:**  
  * At maturity, bondholders can convert bonds into $ETHXR tokens if the token’s market price exceeds the strike price.  
  * Conversion is performed onchain, allowing bondholders to capture appreciation in $ETHXR’s value.  
* **Redemption Option:**  
  * If $ETHXR’s market price does not exceed the strike price, bondholders can redeem the bonds for their principal in USDC, potentially with a fixed yield.  
* **Protocol Benefits:**  
  * USDC raised is immediately used to buy ETH, growing the pool and boosting $ETHXR’s NAV.  
  * Conversion aligns bondholder incentives with the protocol’s long-term success.

#### **2\. At-The-Money (ATM) Offerings:**

If $ETHXR trades at a **premium to NAV**, EtherStrategy issues new tokens to capture demand and grow the ETH pool.

* **Mechanism:**  
  * New $ETHXR tokens are sold at the market price, capped at a percentage per week to maintain upside for existing holders.  
  * Proceeds are used to buy ETH and add it to the pool.  
* **Benefits:**  
  * Prevents runaway premiums by issuing tokens only when $ETHXR is overvalued.  
  * Scales the ETH pool efficiently, increasing NAV for all holders.

#### **3\. Net Asset Value (NAV) Options:**
* **Mechanism:**
  * Allows the governance to reward contributors or other parties like market makers for their contributions
* **Benefits:**  
  * Zero cost to the platform and are only valuable if $ETHXR exogenously trades at a premium to NAV 

#### **4\. Governance:**
* **Mechanism:**
  * From genesis, $ETHXR holders are in complete control of the protocol
  * $ETHXR is both the token representing the net asset value and the governance token
  * Protocol is designed to be egalitarian and takes no fee on deposits or redemption
  * Governance is vulnerable to a 51% attack, to mitigate this governance includes a rage quit functionality
    * One of these conditions are true:
      * Token transfers are paused by governance
      * Proposal succeeds and is in queue within the 24 hour execution delay before execution
          * $ETHXR holder or their delegate voted no or did not cast a vote (casting an abstain vote will not allow you to rage quit)
* **Benefits:** 
  * Self determination of the protocol
